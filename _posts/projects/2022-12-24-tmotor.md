In this project, a software driver for Tmotor AK-series motors is designed based on the CAN protocol and a Linux environment. The AK-series motors are lightweight, quasi-direct electric motors with an inbuilt MIT Mini-Cheetah controller, making them suitable for modern robotics applications such as exoskeletons, quadrupeds, and humanoids. This software driver utilizes the standard CAN communication protocol and employs ROS for node management. The entire driver is written in Python and implemented in a Linux environment. Middle-level control functionalities, including motor enable/disable and feedback control of position, velocity, and torque, have been implemented. Additionally, some high-level control functions, such as trajectory planning and tracking, have been tested on a self-designed testbench and a 7-DOF robotic arm.
