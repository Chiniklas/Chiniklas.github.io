			Parallel manipulators are a class of robots characterised by their closed-loop architec-
			ture which gives them the advantages of high precision and load carrying capacity over
			their serial counterparts. Due to the presence of closed kinematic loops, the dynamics
			model consists of both actuated and passive joints related by sizeable symbolic expres-
			sions, evaluation of which hinders the speed of computer simulation. As a result, in
			practice, the dynamics model is often simplified, and control algorithms are used to
			compensate the model inaccuracies. Further, the computation of a model-based control
			input in realistic time scales with a precise formulation of the system remains a chal-
			lenge. Therefore, a dynamics formulation that would enable faster calculations without
			compromising on the fidelity of the model forms the central idea of the report.

<h3> MaMiC: Macro and Micro Curriculum for Robotic Reinforcement Learning <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c4E3lC_ESWjdV5N7xGy3RsyZnFoybXor/view?usp=sharing"> [pdf] </a></h3>

<p style="font-size:100%;"> Shaping in humans and animals has been shown to be a powerful tool for learning complex tasks as compared to learning in a randomized fashion. This makes the problem less complex and enables one to solve the easier sub task at hand first. Generating a curriculum for such guided learning involves subjecting the agent to easier goals first, and then gradually increasing their difficulty. This paper takes a similar direction and proposes a dual curriculum scheme for solving robotic manipulation tasks with sparse rewards, called MaMiC. It includes a macro curriculum scheme which divides the task into multiple subtasks followed by a micro curriculum scheme which enables the agent to learn between such discovered subtasks. We show how combining macro and micro curriculum strategies help in overcoming major exploratory constraints considered in robot manipulation tasks without having to engineer any complex rewards. We also illustrate the meaning of the individual curricula and how they can be used independently based on the task. The performance of such a dual curriculum scheme is analyzed on the Fetch environments.

<h3> MagNex â€” Expendable robotic surgical tooltip <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7989486"> [link] </a></h3>

<p style="font-size:100%;"> This paper presents the design of a single use disposable compliant surgical tooltip for a tele-operated surgical robot. The proposed design aims at mitigating bio-fouling of surgical tools. By implementing a monolithic design for surgical tooltip, the cleaning and sterilization processes needed after every surgery for traditional surgical robotic tools is considerably simplified. The proposed design has 3 degrees of freedom (DOF) with a modified serpentine joint for enhanced buckling strength and off-axis stiffness. A magnetic force based coupling is proposed as a means of transferring power through a hermetic barrier to maneuver the tooltip. The tooltip is thus coupled through a hermetically sealed tool shaft preventing biological material from entering the tool shaft. By having a pluggable tooltip, modularity is also achieved by interchangeable tooltip instead of replacing the whole tool during surgery. A prototype of the proposed design is developed and its functional performance is validated. Owing to the magnetic nexus which forms the magnetic coupling, the tool is named MagNex.
