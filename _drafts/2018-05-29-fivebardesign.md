This post will give you an idea on how to design a parallel manipulator with a simple example of a five bar parallel manipulator. 
The design process is divided into the following steps:
<ol>
<li>Formulate the equations of the loss type singularity curves or the boundary of the manipulator</li>
<li>Formulate the symbolic expression for the gain type singularity of the manipulator</li>
<li>Find the Safe Working Zone(SWZ)</li>
<li>Formulate the objectives of design</li>
<li>Use an optimizer to compute the optimal manipulator parameters</li>
