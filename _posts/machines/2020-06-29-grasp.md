title: "High payload dexterous manipulation using the Yale OpenHand project gripper model Q"
date: 2020-06-29
category: machines
summary: Specification, architecture selection and model parametrisation. Design optimisation using NSGA-II, to match required gripping force specification. Generalisation over generated trajectories using on-line planning and model based trajectory tracking control. Goal-1-Training a simulated agent for robust grasping over a library of shapes through defined trajectories in PyBullet. Goal-2-Sim-2-real transfer using low-level PID controller and higher level RL planner. Goal-3-Interface grasping system with industrial camera for object detection and unknown component manipulation.
