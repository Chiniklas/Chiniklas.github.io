In this project, our team set up a simulation to automate the material transfer process in the vaccine production chain.<br><br>Functions like manual on & off, auto-running, error interruption & resume, status representation, and emergency-stop have been realized using the Siemens PLC platform.<br><br>Multiple programming methods have been attempted, including FBD(Function Block Diagram), LD(Ladder Diagram), IL(Instruction List), SCL(Structured Control Language), SFC(Sequential Function Chart)ã€‚
