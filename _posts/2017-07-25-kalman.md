title: "Kalman Filter Implementation"

I implement the Kalman Filter on a real world like data given in the paper, [1]
Kalman Filter is also called as Linear Quadratic Estimator
If a Kalman Filter is implemented along with a Linear Quadratic Regulator, then such an implementation is called Linear Quadratic Gaussian ! This would be an optimal output feedback controller.
Given a non-linear model of a system, the code is capable of finding the Jacobian of the system also and then implement an EKF for LQE.

In implementing the extended Kalman Filter the there are two parts, one the actual Kalman Filter step and the other is to paralelly find the Jacobian of the system to get instantaneous linearized system coefficients.
To find the Jacobian of the system, you'll need the system differential equations and then linearize them around the current state.

These linearized coefficients are still in the continuous time domain and needs to be changed to discrete time to plug into the formulation.
A closer look at the filtered data can be seen here.

The filter converges, irrespective of the initial guess. The convergence of the filter from a different initial value can be seen here.
