In this project, two topics of optimization in the field of robotics have been discussed, being workspace optimization and control optimization.<br><br>In the workspace optimization, a five-bar parallel structure and a cable-driven musculo-skeletal robot are presented as examples for configuration optimization. And in the control optimization part, a trajectory optimization task has been attempted given the inital and goal point. Eventually, a bi-level optimization method combining workspace and control optimization is introduced for a 2R-robot design.<br><br>
