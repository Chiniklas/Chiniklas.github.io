title: "Vision based petrol tank model identification system"
date: 2020-06-20
category: machines
summary: Developed an end-to-end vision based flexible model identification system. The state-of-the art resnet models from Pytorch are used for identification of the petrol tanks. The entire solution is developed using Flask, a Python based rapid web application deployment package. The model is made modular to allow for on-line addition of new tank designs. A faster inference time and a high frame rate are achieved by optimising the model through quantisation.
