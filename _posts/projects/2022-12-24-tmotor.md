In this project a software and a hardware infrastructure has been established for testing the AK-series motors with an inbuild MIT Mini-Cheetah controller.<br><br>
As for software infrastructure, a GUI based on PyQt has been designed and a CAN bus communication running on ROS noetic has been successfully built. Several essential low-level control functions like motor connection, feedback monitoring(position, velocity and torque), and command transmission are realized.<br><br>
For hardware infrastructure, a lightweight, modular-designed testbench for AK-series motors is attempted. Now the testbench is suitable for AK-60, AK-80, AK-10 with a same base and different holders.
