title: "Vision based weld classification system on the edge"
date: 2020-05-20
category: machines
summary: Robust vision based classification system for different welding of mufflers. Developed an in-house low cost deep learning based machine vision solution using an edge device and a webcamera. Pytorch's mobilenet_v2 improves the frame rate at the cost of classification accuracy between the components when implemented on a resource constraint edge devices. Inference of the serialised model using torch library on C++ further improves the frame rate.
